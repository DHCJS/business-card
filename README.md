## Business Card
The first Scrimba Project I created and deployed on Netlify.

Implement some animations, changing the original colour and adding background pictures.

Throughout this lesson, I’ve learned about:

• Image alt texts

• Flex child containers

• Inheritance

• Shorthands

• Web-safe fonts

• Color palettes
